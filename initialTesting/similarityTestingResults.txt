Similar article: The Paris climate agreement of 2015 was a key moment in the battle against climate change: 195 countries vowed to help limit the rise in global temperatures since the industrial revolution to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3

Main article: Nations must cut in half emissions by the end of the decade to avoid the most catastrophic effects of warming, and start that change immediately, scientists say
Similar article: Pershing said the American proposal  which calls for a reduction in emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, 42 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050  was in keeping with cuts that scientists say would avert the worst dangers, but only if all countries, including emerging economies, did their part

Similar article: Trump has said he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, under which nearly 200 countries agreed to voluntarily reduce greenhouse gases in order to avert the worst effects of global warming

Main article: The climate provisions are designed to quickly transform energy and transportation, the country’s two largest sources of greenhouse gases, from systems that now mostly burn gas, oil and coal to sectors that run increasingly on clean energy from the sun, wind and nuclear power
Similar article: Instead, his campaign has called for new regulations and spending that would accelerate wind, solar, and electric vehicle deployment while investing in nascent technologies like hydrogen (a clean-burning fuel that can be produced from gas or renewables), carbon capture (trapping carbon dioxide from industrial polluters before it escapes into the atmosphere and warms the planet) or advanced nuclear power

Main article: That’s the threshold beyond which scientists say the dangers of global warming — such as deadly heat waves, water shortages, crop failures and ecosystem collapse — grow immensely
Similar article: Rising temperatures, after all, carry their own price, including deadlier heat waves, crop failures, more destructive wildfires and higher sea levels

Main article: The policy aims for the United States to get 80 percent of its electricity from sources that don’t generate carbon dioxide by 2030, up from 40 percent today
Similar article: Still, last year the country derived 80 percent of its total energy from fossil fuels, an unsustainable level if the worst consequences of warming are to be avoided

Main article: Instead of frantically reacting after disaster strikes, the country would better prepared to reduce damage
