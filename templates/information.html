    <p class="title"> Annotated News is a Chrome browser extension that aims to broaden your exposure to different ideas and perspectives across the internet. By annotating news stories, social media posts, and other online information, the tool will help you understand what other people believe and why. There are two types of annotations on the Annotated News Platform: context and counterpoint. Context annotations provide you with some background information or facts to further contextualize a statement. Counterpoint annotations help you expand your views beyond what is stated. They grapple with the multiple perspectives that undoubtedly exist and try to help you stay open minded.  </p>
